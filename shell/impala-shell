# This script runs the Impala shell. Python is required.

# rooted in either the same directory that this script is in, or in a directory
# in the environment variable ${IMPALA_SHELL_HOME}.
#
# The required directories are:
# gen-py/ -- containing the Python thrift stubs for connecting to Impalad
# lib/ -- containing the Hive Beeswax libraries; note this directory exists only in the
#         shell tarball, not the Impala repository, see make_shell_tarball.sh for details
# ext-py${VERSION}/ -- containing all the eggs for the modules packaged with the shell.
